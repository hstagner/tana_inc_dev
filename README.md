Python scripts adapted from "readwise.mjs" in the [Tana Paste Examples Repository](https://github.com/tanainc/tana-paste-examples)

readwise-export-tana dumps all of your Readwise items and highlights into a file so you can copy into Tana.

readwise-export-tana-individual dumps all of your Readwise items and highlights into a file separated by %%tana%% so you can pick individual items for import (in case the copy and paste from all of your files is too much at one time).
